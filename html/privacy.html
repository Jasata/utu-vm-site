                    <p>In brief, you should know:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>You are anonymous for this service</strong>, <u>unless</u> you have specifically requested to be identified as a teacher</li>
                            <li><strong>University of Turku Single Sign-On is trusted explicitly</strong>, making it unnecessary to handle identifiable personal data (not including those that have requested to be identified as teachers).</li>
                            <li><strong>Web server access logs are anonymous.</strong> The automatically collected usage statistics (access and error logs) contain the usual information, such as IP, browser type and version, etc., but are otherwise completely anonymous and (within the capabilities of this service) cannot be connected to any data that identifies you as a person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teachers have their UID stored.</strong> Having the Single Sign-On User ID listed is the only way to identify a teacher and grant authenticated Single Sign-On session with additional access. To be granted teacher access, the user must accept that UID is stored.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h1 id="what-data">What data do we collect?</h1>

                    <p>This website collects the following data:</p>

                    <p><strong>From teachers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UTU Single Sign-On User ID</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><strong>From everyone else:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nothing</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <h1 id="how-we-collect">How do we collect your data?</h1>

                    <p>For anonymous and student access, this website does not collect nor store any identifiable personal data. To be granted teacher access, a single piece of personal data will be stored.</p>

                    <p>A user that contacts us directly and explicitly requests to be identified as a teacher, agrees to have his or her UTU Single Sign-On (henceforth referred to as <strong>SSO</strong>) ID stored in the website's list of teachers. User's UTU SSO ID is requested by the website administration and provided by the user in agreement with the associated terms and provisions.</p>

                    <h1 id="how-we-use-data">How will we use your data?</h1>

                    <p>For teachers, we use the UTU SSO ID to identify the user as a teacher, granting him or her the additional privileges within our website. Additionally, we also record the ownership of all uploaded virtual machine images to the identified teacher, thus allowing him or her to manage those resources.</p>

                    <h1 id="how-we-store-data">How do we store your data?</h1>

                    <p>This website securely stores teacher UTU SSO ID data at a virtual server instance, securely hosted and maintained by UTU IT-Services.</p>
                    
                    <p>This website will keep teacher UTU SSO IDs for as long as the user requires his or her privileges, or as long as the system contains virtual machine images owned by the user, whichever is longer. Once teacher privileges are relinquished and all owned virtual machine images are removed, the UTU SSO ID is deleted from the website.</p>

                    <h1 id="marketing">Marketing</h1>

                    <p>This website would like to send you information about courses and virtual machine images that we think you might like, but since we have no idea who you are, we can't.</p>

                    <h1 id="my-rights">What are your data protection rights?</h1>

                    <p>University of Turku would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:</p>
